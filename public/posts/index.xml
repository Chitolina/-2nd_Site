      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna start to post my Data Science challenges, usually taken from Kaggle site.
House Rocket is a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of the properties using technology. The houses have many attributes that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers, like numbers of bathrooms, rooms, year they were built, if/when they were reformed and other attributes. Following these informations, we can find some questions:</description>
